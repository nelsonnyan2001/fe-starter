# Starter Repository for barebones HTML/CSS/JS projects.

This is a starter repository for all my basic front-end projects. For sites that can be gotten up and running without the need for a whole framework, this is a *HTML-CSS-JS* solution using **Parcel**.

I've also got my .prettierrc config in here, since that's my go-to linter.
